                <p>One of my absolute favorite bakeries in the city. They specialize in ancient grains and sourdough bread, where each loaf is made by hand. Their gluten-free bread is the best Iâ€™ve ever had. Now they are also doing amazing sandwiches on a daily basis (a meaty one and a veggie one), and they sell delicious ferments such as kimchi.</p>

                <p>Another one of my absolute favorites: a mix of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Nordic, and Australian, it is unlike any bakery in Barcelona. There is no seating inside (the space is packed with goodies!), but there are benches outside, and the beach is just a hop and a skip away if you'd like to have breakfast with a view. </p>

                <p>This French bakery is the favorite of many of my readers, so obviously I had to pay them a visit. Now I can definitely see why to is so popular! They make delicious bread and pastries using organic flours, and they have many magnificent gluten-free options. </p>
